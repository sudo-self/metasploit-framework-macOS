# Metasploit Framework in RUBY for macOS
## The Metasploit Framework is released under a BSD-style license. See
[COPYING](COPYING) for more details.
## Nightly https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/getting-started/nightly-installers.html
## Install
Generally, you should use [the free installer](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/getting-started/nightly-installers.html),
which contains all of the dependencies and will get you up and running with a
few clicks. See the [Dev Environment Setup](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/setting-up-a-metasploit-development-environment.html) if
you'd like to deal with dependencies on your own.

Using Metasploit
--
Metasploit can do all sorts of things. The first thing you'll want to do
is start `msfconsole`, but after that, you'll probably be best served by
reading [Metasploit Unleashed][unleashed], the [great community
resources](https://metasploit.github.io), or take a look at the
[Using Metasploit](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html)
page on the documentation website.
